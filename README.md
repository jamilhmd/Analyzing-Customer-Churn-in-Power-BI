Databel Telecom Churn Analysis in Power BI
This Power BI project delves into the churn data of Databel, a fictional telecom company,
to uncover insights into customer attrition rates. Through meticulous data analysis and visualization, 
we aim to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and propose actionable strategies to mitigate it. 
The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of intuitive dashboards that highlight churn trends, 
customer demographics, and service usage patterns. Our goal is to provide Databel with data-driven recommendations to enhance customer retention, 
optimize service offerings, and ultimately reduce churn. 
This case study not only demonstrates the application of Power BI in real-world business scenarios but also offers a template for similar analyses in the telecom sector.
